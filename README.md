Automates donating $15 to Food From The Heart using company allowance on Deliveroo :>

### Usage
1. Install required packages
1. Rename `.env.template` to `.env` and fill in your Deliveroo email and password
1. Run `python3 donate.py`
1. After the automation finishes running, click 'Place delivery order'

The final step (pressing the 'Place delivery order' button) is not automated so as to avoid accidentally donating $15.
